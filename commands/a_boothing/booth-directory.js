 * Sends an embed same channel with the sponsor's name and link to their Zoom boothing room. The embed has 2 states: Open and Closed. 
 * In the Closed state the embed will be red and say the booth is closed, which is the default, and the bot will react to the embed with 
 * a door emoji at the beginning. In the Open state the embed will be green and say the booth is open. Any time a staff or sponsor clicks 
 * on that emoji, the embed changes to the other state. When a booth goes from Closed to Open, it will also notify a role (specified by 
 * the user) that it is open.
 * 
 * @param {message} message - messaged that called this command
 * @param {string} sponsorName - Exact name of the sponsor 
 * @param {string} link - sponsor's Zoom boothing link
